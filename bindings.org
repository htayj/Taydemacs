* general philosophy
** alternating hands is faster
source:
strings of keys should go between hands as much as possible

** dual leader keys
- actions in text editor mode are different from actions in wm mode.
- exwm needs a leader that does not interferre with any keys in any applications (F23 was chosen for this)
- the 2nd leader will be called metaspace or MSPC
- separation of actions into two groups - manipulate text (space) & manipulate emacs (metaspace)
- ( MSPC > ( ( meta minor ) ( SPC > ( space minor ) ) ) )
* metaspace
** metaspace shall work in ALL contexts as a truly global leader
** metaspace shall NOT be dependent on:
- the item under point
- the focused window
- the focused frame
- the current layout of anything on the screen
*** where dependence is defined as the user needing to know the state of the thing in question to know the action taken or outcome of the action
** there is allotted one key in metaspace (MSPC m, meta minor) that may be dependent on:
- whether the currently focused window is exwm or not
- the tag of the window (exwm, social, normal)
- the program that is running in the exwm buffer
** it shall always be possible to reach SPC from metaspace via MSPC SPC
** using MSPC SPC is a sin
